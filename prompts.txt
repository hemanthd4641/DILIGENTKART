			INITIAL PROMPT FOR PROJECT SETUP


You are an expert full-stack web developer. Build a complete, production-ready e-commerce web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB Atlas, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

Core Requirements
Frontend: React.js (with functional components, Hooks, Context API for cart state management, and Axios for API calls).

Backend: Node.js with Express.js for RESTful APIs.

Database: MongoDB Atlas for storing product data, cart items, and user info (optional).

Styling: Use Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive, and modern UI.

Project must be structured into frontend/ and backend/ directories.

Functional Features
1. Product Management

Display all available products on the homepage.

Product data (title, image, price, description, category, rating) should be stored in MongoDB.

Each product card should include "View Details" and "Add to Cart" buttons.

2. Product Details Page

When a user clicks a product, show its full details: image, description, price, and “Add to Cart” button.

3. Shopping Cart

Add/remove items dynamically.

Update quantity in the cart.

Display total price, and item count.

Maintain cart state globally using React Context API or Redux Toolkit.

4. Responsive UI

Fully responsive layout (mobile, tablet, desktop) using Tailwind CSS.

Include a simple navigation bar with logo, home link, and cart icon showing number of items.

5. Backend API Endpoints

GET /api/products → Fetch all products.

GET /api/products/:id → Fetch single product details.

6. Database

Use MongoDB Atlas connection string in .env file.

Product schema: { name, description, price, image, category, rating }.

Seed initial data using a script or static JSON import.





Prompt for technical architecture


You are a senior full-stack solution architect AI
Generate a complete Technical Architecture Documentation for my project.

Project Name is DeligentKart

Goal is to Build a fully functional, production-ready e-commerce website that enables users to explore products, view details, add/remove items to cart, and manage their shopping cart persistently.
